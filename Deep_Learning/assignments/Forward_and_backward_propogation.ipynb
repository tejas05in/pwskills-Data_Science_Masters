    "1. Weights: Weights are associated with the connections between neurons in different layers of the network.

    "1. Vanishing or Exploding Gradients:\n",
    "   In deep neural networks, gradients can become extremely small (vanishing gradients) or extremely large (exploding gradients) as they propagate backward through many layers. This can hinder the learning process. To address this issue:\n",
    "   - Use activation functions that alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, such as ReLU or variants like Leaky ReLU.\n",
    "   - Implement gradient clipping, which bounds the gradients to a predefined threshold, preventing them from exploding.\n",
    "   - Use normalization techniques like batch normalization to stabilize the gradients.\n",

    "2. Unstable or Slow Convergence:\n",
    "   The learning process might be unstable, with slow convergence or erratic behavior. This can be due to a variety of factors:\n",
    "   - Check the learning rate. If it is too high, it may cause oscillations or overshooting. If it is too low, convergence can be slow. Adjust the learning rate accordingly.\n",

    "   - Increase the size of the training dataset to improve generalization and stability.\n",
    "   - Consider using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting and enhance stability.\n",

    "3. Incorrect Implementation of Gradients:\n",
    "   Mistakes in implementing the gradients during backward propagation can lead to incorrect updates of the parameters. To mitigate this issue:\n",
    "   - Double-check the mathematical calculations of gradients to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "   - Use automatic differentiation tools or established deep learning frameworks, which handle the gradient calculations internally.\n",
    "   - Validate the implementation by comparing the gradients with numerical approximations using techniques like gradient checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Overfitting:\n",
    "   Backward propagation can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. To tackle overfitting:\n",
    "   - Increase the size of the training dataset if possible.\n",
    "   - Employ regularization techniques such as dropout, which randomly drops out some neurons during training, or early stopping, which stops training when the performance on a validation set starts deteriorating.\n",
    "   - Adjust the model architecture by reducing the number of parameters or introducing regularization layers like dropout or batch normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "   In large-scale networks or complex architectures, backward propagation can be computationally expensive. To improve efficiency:\n",
    "   - Utilize efficient implementations provided by deep learning libraries that leverage parallel computing (e.g., GPU acceleration).\n",
